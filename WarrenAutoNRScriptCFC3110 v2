#The goal is to create a script that automatically connects to a remote server
#All the user needs to do is key in ssh IP, User ID, and Password
#At then at the end of the script, prompt the user to exit or start again



#	Script wrapped in a function and case at the end to increase usability

function AUTOSCAN()

#1.		Install the needed applications.
#1.2	If the applications are already installed, donâ€™t install them again

#	Commands are put into a variable as it is cleaner and easier to call 
#	upon when necessary
